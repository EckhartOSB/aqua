aqua -- Advanced Query Using Abook

This utility replaces the mutt-query function of abook
with one that can:

1. Search all fields, not just name and email
2. Search specific fields
3. Combine criteria with and/or/not
4. Group operations with parentheses
5. Use regular expressions

See the man page for details.
